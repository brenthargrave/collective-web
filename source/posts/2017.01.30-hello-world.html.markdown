# Introducing: the Singular Collective

Why do you freelance?

It affords you *time*.	
Time to pursue your own mission.	
Time, and the *integrity* to pursue that mission instead of committing years to someone else's.

If you freelance independently, though, you're struggling to advance your cause. Ambitious projects grow on momentum, built atop *consistent* effort. Yet consistency is difficult to secure navigating the "feast and famine" of solo freelance work. The free time that opens up between engagements is wasted if you have to put everything on hold when the next engagement lands.

The solution is simple, right? Distribute the work load! So you start asking your talented friends to help with new engagements. But this also fails, eventually: you don't always know their availability, and certainly can't guarantee it. Consistency still eludes you.

At this point, you could do as so many have done before: hire people to guarantee their time. But you guarantee their salaries in exchange, and full-timers expect a career path. Congrats, you've just started an agency!

But was that your ambition? To run an agency?

It's definitely not ours. And if it's not yours either, join us!	
We're trying something different.

We're a small group of creatives designing an unusual organization, one that retains the desirable aspects of the "agency model" (eg. a respected shared brand, world-class colleagues, and a pipeline of challenging engagements) that jettisons the rest (salaries, well-worn career paths).

Our plan, in a nutshell:	

1. Work together to define processes and build tools that *effectively* help us achieve our unique goals. Publish our methods, tools, and project work for prospective members and clients to see. 
1. In helping each other, attract a deeper bench of like-minded colleagues to work with. As the team is excellent, so is the work: mission-focused creatives do great work because, *by definition*, we care so deeply about results.[^types]
1. The work attracts more, and more *attractive*, client engagements. Jon Lax put it best: "There is no magic to this business. If you do good work, you get good work."[^lax]	

If this appeals to you, [say hello](hello@singularcollective.co)! We can't wait to discuss your ambitions, your skills and your availability.

[^types]: Most of us have been through startup wringer at least once. And we use the broad term "creative" deliberately: if you're ambitious and possess skills of *any* stripe applicable to our work, we want your help.
