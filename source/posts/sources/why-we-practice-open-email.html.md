Our email address is weird: "**everyone**@singularcollective.co"

We chose "everyone" to advertise to the outside world, especially to recruits and prospective clients, that our collective internally practices "open email," where every member cc's the entire membership in their work emails, by default.

If this strikes you as *crazy*, we encourage you to read about implementations of this practice at wildly successful companies like Google and Stripe.[^others] The benefits are real and numerous, but here at Singular we care about one in particular: trust.

Trust, by our members in us, that when we ask them to share their time, energy, reputation and relationships with the group that the fruits of those contributions will be visible to them, not hidden or obfuscated. Everyone contributes, and so everyone needs to see the raw, unadulterated results of our collective effort, good or bad, however messy. Without this transparency and the trust it builds, our members walk.

Open email enhances other organizations.	
Without it, ours might not exist.
