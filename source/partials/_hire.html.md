### Singular is a collective, not an agency.	

We're a group of ambitious creatives working together closely to better serve our clients, and to help each other pursue our goals beyond freelancing. We're results-oriented in the extreme. We'll create for you like we create for ourselves.

> If you want something done, ask a busy person to do it.

### Our Work

**[New York Sports Clubs (NYSC)](https://newyorksportsclubs.com)**		
Hired by [Kettle](https://kettlenyc.com) to work alongside their product, design and server engineering teams to build [the new NYSC iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sportsclubs-nysc-bsc-psc-wsc/id1120257245), a (small) part of Kettle's extensive brand work for the clubs. 	
Read their [full case study](https://kettlenyc.com/case-studies/nysc)!

**[Open mHealth](http://www.openmhealth.org/)**		
Open mHealth designs and evangelizes new standards for the ever-growing data generated by our mobile devices (steps, sleep, etc.) To support this evangelization effort, we built an open-source iOS library, [Granola](https://github.com/openmhealth/Granola), that every iOS health app developer should use in their code. And we built an app using Granola, called [Hipbone](https://hipboneapp.com), that syncs your Health app's data with your Dropbox account, in order to let anyone with an iPhone see Open mHealth's standards at work.
